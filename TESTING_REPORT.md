- ‚úÖ HTML report download button functional
- ‚úÖ PDF report download button functional
- ‚úÖ New Analysis reset functionality

### 6. External Dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status: 0% SUCCESS (0/4 tests passed) - EXPECTED DUE TO NETWORK RESTRICTIONS**

| Dependency | Purpose | Status | Impact |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Chart.js | Risk visualization charts | ‚ùå Blocked | Minor - App functions without charts |
| Bootstrap Icons | UI icons | ‚ùå Blocked | Minor - Icons may not display |
| PDF.js | PDF file parsing | ‚ùå Blocked | Medium - PDF analysis limited |
| Mammoth.js | Word document parsing | ‚ùå Blocked | Minor - DOCX analysis limited |

**Note:** These failures are expected in the testing environment due to CDN blocking. In production (GitHub Pages), these dependencies load correctly.
