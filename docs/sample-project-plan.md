# Enterprise Customer Portal
## Azure Application Registration Project Plan

**Project Name:** Enterprise Customer Portal  
**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Date:** August 10, 2024  
**Author:** IT Security Team  
**Classification:** Internal Use  
**Review Status:** Pending Security Assessment  

## Executive Summary

The Enterprise Customer Portal is a comprehensive web application designed to provide secure access to customer data, financial records, and administrative functions. This application requires extensive Azure Active Directory permissions to integrate with Microsoft Graph API and provide seamless user experience across the organization.

## Project Objectives

• Provide secure customer data access with role-based permissions  
• Implement comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements  
• Enable administrative functions for user and group management  
• Integrate with existing directory services and applications  
• Ensure GDPR and SOX compliance for financial data handling  
• Support multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies  

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using Microsoft .NET Core 6.0 with Azure AD integration. It leverages Microsoft Graph API for user management, SharePoint for document access, and Exchange Online for email communications. The application implements OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with PKCE for enhanced security.

### Security Requirements

• Multi-factor authentication mandatory for all users  
• Conditional access policies based on location and device compliance  
• Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for administrative roles  
• Regular access reviews and automated de-provisioning  
• Encryption in transit and at rest for sensitive data  
• Comprehensive audit logging with 7-year retention  

## Required Azure Application Permissions

The following Microsoft Graph API permissions are required for the application to function properly. Each permission has been evaluated for necessity and follows the principle of least privilege.

### Critical Risk Permissions

**Directory.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Required for managing organizational units and administrative settings

**RoleManagement.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Needed for automated role assignment and access provisioning

### High Risk Permissions

**Application.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Required for managing application registrations and service principals

**User.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Needed for user provisioning and profile management

**Group.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Required for dynamic group management and security group operations

**Policy.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Needed for conditional access policy automation

**Files.ReadWrite.All**  
Justification: Required for SharePoint document management and file operations

### Medium Risk Permissions

**Directory.Read.All**  
Justification: Required for reading organizational structure and user relationships

**Application.Read.All**  
Justification: Needed for application discovery and configuration validation

**User.Read.All**  
Justification: Required for user profile access and directory browsing

**AuditLog.Read.All**  
Justification: Needed for security monitoring and compliance reporting

**SecurityEvents.Read.All**  
Justification: Required for threat detection and incident response

### Low Risk Permissions

**Mail.Read**  
Justification: Required for reading user emails in customer service scenarios

**Group.Read.All**  
Justification: Needed for group membership validation and access control

**User.Read**  
Justification: Basic profile access for authentication and user identification

**profile**  
Justification: Standard OpenID Connect profile claims

**openid**  
Justification: Standard OpenID Connect authentication

**email**  
Justification: Email address access for user identification

## Compliance and Risk Management

### GDPR Compliance

The application implements data protection by design and by default. Personal data processing is limited to legitimate business purposes with appropriate technical and organizational measures. Users have full rights to access, rectify, and erase their personal data as required by GDPR Articles 15-17.

### SOX Compliance

Financial data access is restricted to authorized personnel with appropriate segregation of duties. All financial transactions are logged with immutable audit trails. Access controls are reviewed quarterly and any changes require management approval.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment

• IDENTIFY (ID): Asset management and risk assessment procedures implemented  
• PROTECT (PR): Access control and data security measures in place  
• DETECT (DE): Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection configured  
• RESPOND (RS): Incident response procedures and communication plans established  
• RECOVER (RC): Recovery planning and backup procedures documented
